# Android/Termux Anti-Debug Fix Summary

## Problem
The ShadowSeal encrypted file execution was failing on Termux/Android environments due to overly aggressive anti-debugging detection causing false positives.

## Root Cause
The anti-debugging system was detecting normal Android/Termux environment characteristics as debugging attempts, preventing encrypted Python files from running.

## Solution
Modified `utils/anti_debug.py` to be more lenient on Android/Termux environments by:

### 1. Added Android/Termux Detection
- Added `is_android()` function to detect Android/Termux environments
- Uses multiple indicators: `/system/build.prop`, `/system/bin/getprop`, `TERMUX` environment variable

### 2. Relaxed Anti-Debug Checks
Modified these functions to skip aggressive checks on Android/Termux:
- `check_ptrace()` - Skips ptrace checks
- `check_debugger_processes()` - Skips process scanning
- `check_debugger_env()` - Allows LD_PRELOAD on Android
- `check_tracerpid()` - Skips tracer PID checks
- `check_parent_process()` - Skips parent process checks
- `check_sys_trace()` - Allows Python tracing
- `check_time_anomaly()` - Skips timing checks
- `check_memory_anomaly()` - Skips memory pattern checks
- `check_cpu_anomaly()` - Skips CPU usage checks

### 3. Environment-Specific Behavior
- On Android/Termux: All anti-debug checks return `False`
- On other platforms: Original behavior preserved

## Files Modified
- `utils/anti_debug.py` - Added Android detection and relaxed checks

## Testing
- Created test files to verify the fix
- Encrypted file `test_simple.shc` was successfully created
- Anti-debug detection now returns `False` on Android/Termux

## Usage
After this fix, encrypted Python files should execute successfully on Termux/Android without triggering false debugging detection.

```bash
shadowseal encrypt script.py -o script.shc
shadowseal run script.shc  # Should work on Termux now
