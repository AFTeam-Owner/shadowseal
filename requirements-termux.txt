# Lightweight requirements for Termux/Android
# Skip heavy dependencies that cause installation issues

# Core cryptography - use system packages when possible
cryptography>=41.0.0

# Skip psutil on Termux (causes compilation issues)
# Skip cython (not needed for basic functionality)
# Skip rust (too heavy for mobile)

# Pure Python alternatives
# Note: Some functionality will be limited but core encryption works
